Provider: "Hi Mr. James. Your doctor requested a urology consult to see if any interventions are needed with your kidney stone."
Patient: "Oh ok - hi."
Provider: "How is your pain? What would you rank it on a scale from 1 to 10?"
Patient: "I would say a 10 out of 10."
Provider: "I'm sorry, did you say 2 out of 10?"
Patient: "No, 10 not 2."
Provider: "Is the pain medication - ketorolac - helping?"
Patient: "A little bit."
Provider: "Got it. And that's on your right side?"
Patient: "Yes. My right lower back, but I feel it in my groin area too. And it's not all the time, but it comes in sharp bursts."
Provider: "Are you having any nausea or vomiting?"
Patient: "Yes, but it's gotten better."
Provider: "Are you having any pain when you pee?"
Patient: "Nope."
Provider: "Have you seen any blood in your pee?"
Patient: "No."
Provider: "And I see in your chart that you had an obstructing kidney stone that required ureteroscopy about 2 years ago?"
Patient: "Yes, that's right."
Provider: "Ok. I'm going to do my exam now. Your abdomen is soft and non-distended. Can you please sit up? Is this pain full when I tap here?"
Patient: "It hurts a little bit."
Provider: "So mild right CVA tenderness. I'm also going to check your scrotum. I'm not seeing any swelling. Are you having any tenderness?"
Patient: "No, not at all."
Provider: "Based on my assessment, I do think we should proceed with ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy and place a ureteral stent. We will be reviewing the risks with the procedure and will get your consent. Depending on how the procedure goes, we may need to stage them. After the procedure you may experience some pain when peeing and may feel urgency with the stent. I will plan to schedule the procedure for tomorrow morning. Do you have any questions?"
Patient: "No, that sounds good doc."
